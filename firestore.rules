/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset establishes a strict user-ownership model for the Cascade Rewards application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model ensures that users can only access and manage their own data. All data is scoped under a user-specific document in the `/users` collection, and access is granted only if the request's authentication UID matches the document ID. This creates a secure, private data space for each user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized in a single top-level collection: `/users`. Each document within this collection is identified by a unique `userId`, which corresponds directly to the user's Firebase Authentication UID.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores the profile and data for a single user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No Public User Listing: To protect user privacy and prevent data scraping, listing all documents in the `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Strict Ownership: All read, update, and delete operations on a user's document are restricted to the authenticated owner of that document.
 * - Self-Creation: A newly authenticated user is permitted to create their own user document, but no one else's.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, the rules enforce that the `id` field inside the user document must match the document's ID (`userId`), cementing the ownership link. This `id` field is immutable and cannot be changed on update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model is simple and flat, using the document ID (`userId`) as the primary key for authorization. This avoids the need for costly `get()` calls to other documents to determine access rights, leading to fast and efficient rule execution.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The use of a single `/users` collection where each document represents a distinct user's private data naturally enforces structural segregation. All documents within this collection share the same strict ownership security rule.
